    <h1>Catalyst Cash Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="meta">Effective date: 2026-02-25</div>

    <div class="card">
      <p>Welcome to Catalyst Cash. By downloading, accessing, or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Application.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Native Engine & AI API Providers</h2>
    <p>Catalyst Cash is a financial software tool designed to organize, calculate, and construct financial plans. The
      application uses a "Direct-to-Provider" method to forward these constraints to an AI provider of your choice
      (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic). <strong>You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the Terms of
        Service of your chosen third-party AI provider</strong> and for managing your own API keys or subscription fees.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Not Professional Financial Advice</h2>
    <p><strong>Catalyst Cash is not a certified financial planner, broker, or tax advisor.</strong> All insights, plans,
      and debt strategies generated by the app and AI providers are mathematically driven suggestions meant for
      educational and organizational purposes only. You should always consult with a licensed financial professional
      before making any significant financial decisions.</p>

    <h2>3. Accuracy of Output & Algorithmic Liability</h2>
    <p>The calculations and forecasts (such as the Cash Flow Calendar and Monte Carlo Simulator) depend entirely on the
      accuracy of the data you provide. We do not warrant or guarantee that any mathematical output, tax estimate, or
      financial prediction made by the app or its associated large language models will be 100% accurate, flawless, or
      free of "hallucinations." <strong>By using Catalyst Cash, you explicitly acknowledge that Large Language Models
        can and will make arithmetic mistakes. You agree to hold the developer(s) of Catalyst Cash completely harmless
        for any and all algorithmic errors, UI bugs, or incorrect financial guidance that results in capital
        loss.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Liability & Data Loss</h2>
    <p>Catalyst Cash stores your data locally on your device. We do not actively maintain cloud backups of your personal
      financial information unless you explicitly trigger a backup to your device's native file system or a paired
      provider like iCloud. <strong>We are not liable for any data loss, financial damages, or penalties you may suffer
        as a result of using the Application, lost passwords, or misplaced API keys.</strong></p>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Access Limits</h2>
    <p>Should you choose to subscribe to a hosted tier instead of supplying your own API key, your usage will be subject
      to reasonable rate limits designed to prevent abuse and ensure uptime for all customers. Refusal to abide by these
      limits constitutes grounds for account termination without refund.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Catalyst Cash, its creators, affiliates, or
      licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages,
      including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses.
      <strong>Under no circumstances will Catalyst Cash be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from
        hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the service or your account or the information
        contained therein.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms & Future Service Evolution</h2>
    <p>Catalyst Cash is continuously evolving. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, including and
      especially to accommodate <strong>future transitions to hosted backend architectures, cloud synchronization
        features, or new premium subscription tiers.</strong> If we make material changes to how your data is processed
      or stored, we will notify you within the Application or by updating the Effective Date of this document. Your
      continued use of the Application following such updates signifies your acceptance of any revisions.</p>
