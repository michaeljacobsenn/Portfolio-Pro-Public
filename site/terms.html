    <h1>Catalyst Cash Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="meta">Effective date: 2026-03-01 · Last updated: 2026-03-01</div>

    <div class="card">
      <p>Welcome to Catalyst Cash ("the Application", "the App"). By downloading, accessing, or using the Application,
        you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use
        the Application.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old and able to lawfully enter into and form contracts under applicable law to
      use the Application. The Application is intended for residents of the United States and is governed by U.S. law.
      By using the Application, you represent that you meet these eligibility requirements.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Catalyst Cash is a personal financial management tool designed to help you organize, track, and analyze your
      finances. The Application uses a "Direct-to-Provider" architecture to send your locally-entered financial data to
      third-party AI providers of your choice for analysis. You control what data is entered and when it is shared.</p>

    <h2>3. Not Professional Financial Advice — No Fiduciary Relationship</h2>
    <div class="card warning">
      <p style="color: #F8FAFC; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT FINANCIAL DISCLAIMER</strong><br><br>
        Catalyst Cash and its creators are <strong>NOT</strong> registered investment advisors, broker-dealers,
        certified
        financial planners, tax advisors, or fiduciaries. We do not provide personalized investment advice and
        <strong>do not act in a fiduciary capacity</strong>.<br><br>
        All insights, analyses, health scores, recommendations, and AI-generated outputs are for
        <strong>informational and educational purposes only</strong>. They are not tailored to your individual financial
        situation, risk tolerance, or investment objectives beyond the data you manually provide.<br><br>
        <strong>You should always consult with a qualified, licensed financial professional before making any
          significant financial decisions.</strong> All investment strategies and investments involve risk of loss.
        Past performance is not indicative of future results.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. AI-Generated Content & Limitations</h2>
    <p>The Application utilizes third-party AI models (such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude) to
      generate financial analyses and conversational responses. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI outputs may be inaccurate.</strong> Large Language Models can and do make arithmetic mistakes,
        generate "hallucinations," or produce misleading content. You agree to independently verify any calculations,
        advice, or recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>AI lacks judgment.</strong> AI-generated responses lack human judgment, personal context, and
        professional expertise. They are not a substitute for qualified financial advice.</li>
      <li><strong>No guarantee of accuracy.</strong> We make no warranties as to the accuracy, reliability,
        completeness,
        or timeliness of any AI-generated output.</li>
      <li><strong>Your responsibility.</strong> You are solely responsible for how you use AI outputs and for any
        financial decisions you make based on them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party AI Providers</h2>
    <p>When you use AI features (audits, chat), your data is sent directly from your device to the AI provider you
      selected. <strong>You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the Terms of Service of your chosen
        third-party AI provider</strong> and for managing your own API keys or subscription fees. Catalyst Cash is not
      affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any AI provider.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Integrations (Plaid)</h2>
    <p>If you choose to connect bank accounts via Plaid, you authorize Plaid to access your financial account
      information
      in accordance with <a href="https://plaid.com/legal" target="_blank">Plaid's Terms of Service</a> and
      <a href="https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank">End User Privacy Policy</a>.
      Catalyst Cash does not store your bank login credentials. We are not responsible for the accuracy or availability
      of data retrieved from third-party financial institutions via Plaid.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Subscriptions, Payments & Refunds</h2>
    <p>Catalyst Cash may offer subscription tiers ("Free" and "Pro"). All subscriptions are managed through Apple's
      App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and refund policies. Subscription fees are charged in U.S. Dollars.
      You may cancel your subscription at any time through your device's subscription settings. If you use your own
      API key, usage costs are determined by your AI provider and are your sole responsibility.</p>

    <h2>8. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or modify the Application</li>
      <li>Use the Application for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purpose</li>

      <li>Distribute, sublicense, or commercially exploit the Application without written consent</li>
      <li>Use the Application to generate financial advice for others in a professional capacity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Application, including its design, code, and content, is the property of its creators and is protected by
      copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive,
      non-transferable license to use the Application for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>10. Data & Privacy</h2>

      information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device and any data stored on it.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CATALYST CASH, ITS CREATORS, AFFILIATES,
      DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
      CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE,
      DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE
      APPLICATION OR ITS CONTENT.</p>
    <p><strong>Under no circumstances will Catalyst Cash be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting
        from:</strong></p>

    </ul>

    <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Catalyst Cash and its creators, affiliates, directors,
      officers,
      employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or
      debt arising from: (a) your use of the Application; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any
      third-party right, including any intellectual property or privacy right; or (d) any claim that your use of the
      Application caused damage to a third party.</p>

    <h2>13. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APPLICATION AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE,
      OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

    <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance
      with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), rather than in court, except that either party may
      seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property matters. THE PARTIES WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
      AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>

      regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>16. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full
      force and effect.</p>

    <h2>17. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>Catalyst Cash is continuously evolving. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make
      material changes, we will notify you within the Application or by updating the Effective Date. Your continued use
      of the Application following such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>18. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Application at any time, with or without cause,
      and with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the Application ceases immediately. Provisions
      that by their nature should survive termination (including limitations of liability, indemnification, and
      dispute resolution) shall survive.</p>
