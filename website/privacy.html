            <h2 class="section-title">1. App Data & Device Storage</h2>
            <p>Catalyst Cash operates on a "Native Edge" privacy model. The core principle of the app is that your
                financial data is fully encrypted and stored securely on your local device. Catalyst Cash does not
                maintain user accounts on our servers, nor do we harvest, store, or sell your financial data.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">2. AI Integration & APIs</h2>
            <p>If you choose to enter API keys for AI models (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google), these keys are
                stored securely on your device. When an audit is initiated, your input data is sent directly from your
                device to your explicitly chosen provider via their API. We advise reviewing the respective privacy
                policies of these third-party AI services.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">3. Analytics & Diagnostics</h2>
            <p>No analytics, telemetry, or user tracking SDKs are bundled into the application. We do not track your
                clicks, sessions, or financial inputs.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">4. Passcode & Biometrics</h2>
            <p>App Lock and Vault access depend entirely on Apple's standard Keychain and biometric APIs (Face ID /
                Touch ID). Biometric data is never shared with us and never leaves your device.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
                Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
