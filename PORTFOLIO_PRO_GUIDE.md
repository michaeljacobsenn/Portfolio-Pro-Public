## 01 / The Auditor's Philosophy

Catalyst Cash is an elite **Financial Command Center** designed for individuals who demand absolute control and deterministic wealth growth. It treats your personal capital as a high-performance engine.

*   **Native Edge:** Zero data leaves your device. Biometric Lock ensures your Private Rules stay private.
*   **Manual Freedom:** Designed to bypass API limitations and subscription paywalls using **Manual Clipboard Mode**.
*   **Waterfall Logic:** Hierarchical decision tree that ensures survival (minimum cash floors) before aggressive payoffs.

## 02 / The Weekly Operating Routine

Follow this 4-step sequence every Sunday morning to maintain total fiscal agency.

1.  **Snapshot:** Enter your current balances (checking, savings, investments, card balances). Any 2+ fields unlock the payload.
2.  **The Bundle:** Tap `Copy Full Payload` to package your financial state, custom constants, and system prompts.
3.  **The Audit:** Open your preferred AI app (ChatGPT or Gemini) and paste your payload into the chat.
4.  **The Bridge:** Copy the AI's response and tap `Paste & Import Result` to refresh your dashboard with actionable advice.

> **AUDITOR INSIGHT**
> By using the .txt Instruction Bundle via Manual Clipboard Mode, you give the AI a persistent memory of your complex rules, making updates lightning fast without relying on precarious API connections.

## 03 / Financial Constants & Profile

To generate deterministic advice, the AI calculates outcomes against your exact Financial Constants. Configure these in the `Financial Profile` tab under Settings.

*   **Account Tracking:** Toggle which balances (Checking, Savings) appear in the audit input form. Disabled accounts are hidden and not required.
*   **Income & Budget:** Set your pay frequency, payday, and accurate paycheck amounts. The system relies on *post-tax* (take-home) numbers for accurate budgeting.
*   **Additional Income:** Track freelance or side-gig income explicitly so the AI understands total cash flow.
*   **Debts & Credit:** Toggle minimum payment tracking for optimized debt avalanches or snowballs.
*   **Targets & Limits:** Set your `Emergency Liquid Floor`—the minimum cash buffer the AI will never let you breach. Pinpoint your estimated tax bracket for localized projections.
*   **Rules & Advanced:** Tweak elite logic features like Arbitrage tracking, Big Ticket Planner, Insurance pacing, and customizable micro-habit trackers.

## 04 / Security & Fast Access

The Security Suite protects your net worth and private rules using native iOS biometrics.

1.  **Passcode Setup:** Go to `App Preferences` → `Security Suite`. Toggle `Require Passcode` and create a 4-digit PIN.
2.  **Biometric Enrollment:** Toggle `Enable Face ID`. The system will trigger a native prompt to link your biometrics to the app.
3.  **Relock Precision:** Adjust the `Relock After` timer to balance security with workflow efficiency.

> **IMPORTANT:** Security settings (passcode, Face ID) are **device-local only** and are never included in backups or cloud syncs. You must re-configure security on each device. This protects you if a backup file is ever intercepted.

## 05 / Building Your Portfolio

A high-fidelity audit requires accurate card and subscription data. Initialize these first.

*   **Card Portfolio:** Add cards with their exact `Credit Limit` and `APR`. Note any promotional 0% periods. Tap the edit (✎) icon to change a card's issuer or product — ideal for product changes and upgrades.
    *   *Waived Fee Logic:* Check the `Waived?` box for first-year-free promotions. The card still appears in the **Expenses** tab with a `WAIVED` badge and the next renewal date pushed +1 year.
*   **Expenses & Bills:** Your unified hub for all recurring and one-time costs. Annual fees auto-populate from your card portfolio. One-time expenses vanish automatically once their due date passes.
*   **Vaults & Sinking Funds:** Define your long-term needs in the Tracker. The AI uses your paycheck rhythm to calculate exact weekly pacing requirements.

## 06 / Data Governance

You own your data. Catalyst Cash provides tools for backup, migration, and purging under the `Backup & Data` tab.

*   **JSON Export:** Tap `EXPORT JSON` to save a complete backup of your financial system state. Security credentials are excluded for your protection.
*   **The Restore:** Tap `RESTORE` and select a previous JSON backup to instantly rebuild your portfolio. Older backup files import cleanly — even those made before the security update.
*   **Cloud Sync:** Connect Google or Apple to enable automatic encrypted backups. Syncs trigger automatically on data changes (5-second debounce).
*   **Danger Zone (Irreversible Actions):**
    *   *Clear Audit History:* Deletes snapshots only. Cards, settings, and expenses remain intact.
    *   *Factory Reset:* Wipes 100% of data. Returns the application to a blank, factory state.
